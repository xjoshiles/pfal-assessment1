to-do:
- Could my routes be written better?
- random method in collections_controller
- comment users_controller
- should the validation happen within the try block in my controllers?
- do I need any other methods in my comments controller, e.g. delete?
- try block on store method on comments controller?

- /sets/{setId} - Update flashcard set by ID
- /sets/{setId}/cards - Get all flashcards in a set <- new controller


- vvvv new controller
- /users/{userId}/collections
- /users/{userId}/collections/{collectionId}
- /users/{userId}/collections/{collectionId}
- /users/{userId}/collections/{collectionId}
- /collections/random


- Should we delete previous access tokens in auth_controller?
- Should we return a message on success in some controllers too?
- Return flashcards in a set in flashcards_controller store method
- get api version (top of OpenAPI spec)
- implement limit of 20 flashcard sets per day (modifiable)
- user sign up with username and password
- give admins their own dashboard from within which they can
  select a user, modify their admin status and flashcard limits.
- give users their own account dashboard where they can change
  their passwords (and maybe usernames?)



To safely delete a migration file:
- node ace migration:status     (make sure it is pending, i.e. not completed)
- delete the file
- node ace migration:refresh
- node ace migration:status     (ensure that it is gone)

Get routes:
node ace list:routes


auto-indent code:
shift + alt + f


"If you are using the @adonisjs/auth module, hashing passwords within your
model is unnecessary. The AuthFinder automatically handles password hashing,
ensuring your user credentials are securely processed. Learn more about
this process here".


Can collections have comments?

A FlashcardSet can have many Collections, and a Collection can have many
FlashcardSets.
